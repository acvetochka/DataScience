### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

```python
(3*4)+5
# 17
```

This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

```python
200/60
# 3.3333333333333335
```

**Objectives:**

- List popular languages for Data Science.
- Identify commonly used libraries in Data Science.
- Understand the role of various open-source tools for Data Science.
- Demonstrate basic arithmetic expressions in Python.
- Convert time units from minutes to hours using Python.
